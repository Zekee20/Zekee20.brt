<h2 style="font-family:verdana;color:lightgray;"id="C1">Here With Me</h2>
<pre><p style="font-family:verdana;color:white;font-size;160%">
Watch the sun rise along the coast
As we're both getting old
I can't describe what I'm feeling
And all I know is we're going home
So please don't let me go
Don't let me go

And if it's right, I don't care
How long it takes
As long as I'm with you
I've got a smile on my face
Save your tears
It'll be okay
All I know
Is you're here with me

Oh-woah-woah-woah-woah

Watch the sun rise
As we're getting old
Oh-oh
I can't describe, oh, oh
I wish
I could live through every memory again
Just one more time before we float off in the wind
And all the time we spent
Waiting for the light to take us in
Have been the greatest moments of my life

I don't care
How long it takes
As long as I'm with you
I've got a smile on my face
Save your tears
It'll be okay
You're here with me

Oh-woah-woah-woah-woah
I can't describe, oh, oh
</pre></p>


<h2 style="font-family:verdana;color:lightgray;"id="C2">Line Without A Hook</h2>
<pre><p style="font-family:verdana;color:white;font-size;160%">
I don't really give a damn about the way you touch me
When we're alone
You can hold my hand
If no one's home
Do you like it when I'm away?
If I went and hurt my body, baby
Would you love me the same?
I can feel all my bones coming back
And I'm craving motion
Mama never really learned how to live by herself

It's a curse
And it's growing
You're a pond and I'm an ocean
Oh, all my emotions
Feel like explosions when you are around
And I've found a way to kill the sounds, oh

Oh, baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you
I need you here to stay
I broke all my bones that day I found you
Crying at the lake
Was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden?
Oh, and if I could take it all back
I swear that I would pull you from the tide

Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
I said no, I said no
Listen close, it's a no
The wind is a-pounding on my back
And I found hope in a heart attack
Oh, at last, it is past
Now I've got it, and you can't have it

Oh, baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you
I need you here to stay
I broke all my bones that day I found you
Crying at the lake
Was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden? Oh
And if I could take it all back
I swear that I would pull you from the tide

Darling, when I'm fast asleep
I've seen this person watching me
Saying, "Is it worth it? Is it worth it? Tell me, is it worth it?"

'Cause there is something, and there is nothing
There is nothing in between
And in my eyes, there is a tiny dancer
Watching over me, he's singing
"She's a, she's a lady, and I am just a boy"
He's singing, "She's a, she's a lady, and I am just a line without a hook"

Oh, baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you
I need you here to stay
Broke all my bones that day I found you
Crying at the lake
Was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden? Oh
And if I could take it all back
I swear that I would pull you from the tide

<h2 style="font-family:verdana;color:lightgray;"id="C3">Blue</h2>
<pre><p style="font-family:verdana;color:white;font-size;160%">
Your morning eyes I could stare like watching stars
I could walk you by, and I'll tell without a thought
You'll be mine, would you mind if I took your hand tonight?
Know you're all that I want this life

I'll imagine we fell in love
I'll nap under moonlight skies with you
I think I'll picture us, you with the waves
The ocean's colors on your face
I'll leave my heart with your air
So let me fly with you
Will you be forever with me?

My love will always stay by you
I'll keep it safe, so don't you worry a thing, I'll tell you I love you more
It's stuck with you forever, so promise you won't let it go
I'll trust the universe will always bring me to you

I'll imagine we fell in love
I'll nap under moonlight skies with you
I think I'll picture us, you with the waves
The ocean's colors on your face
I'll leave my heart with your air
So let me fly with you
Will you be forever with me?

<h2 style="font-family:verdana;color:lightgray;"id="C4">To The Bone</h2>
<pre><p style="font-family:verdana;color:white;font-size;160%">Have I ever told you
I want you to the bone?
Have I ever called you
When you are all alone?
And if I ever forget
To tell you how I feel
Listen to me now, babe
I want you to the bone

I want you to the bone
I want you to the bone

Oh, maybe if you can see
What I feel through my bones
And every corner in me, oh
There's your presence that grown
Maybe I nurture it more
By saying how I feel
But I did mean it before
I want you to the bone
I want you to

Take me home, I'm fallin'
Love me long, I'm rollin'
Losing control, body and soul
Mind too for sure, I'm already yours
Walk you down, I'm all in
Hold you tight, you call and
I'll take control, your body and soul
Mind too for sure, I'm already yours

Would that be alright? Yeah
Hey, would that be alright?

I want you to the bone, yeah
So bad I can't breathe, no
I want you to the bone

Of all the ones that begged to stay
I'm still longing for you
Of all the ones that cried their way
I'm still waiting on you

Maybe we seek for something that
We couldn't ever have
Maybe we choose the only love
We know we won't accept

Or maybe we're taking all the risks
For something that is real
'Cause maybe the greatest love of all
Is who the eyes can't see, yeah

Take me home, I'm fallin'
Love me long, I'm rollin'
Losing control, body and soul
Mind too for sure, I'm already yours
Walk you down, I'm all in
Hold you tight, you call and
I'll take control, your body and soul
Mind too for sure, I'm already yours

Would you just take me home?
Would you just love me long?
Should I keep hoping on?
Should I keep hoping on?
Could I just take you home?
Could I just love you long?
Should I keep hoping on?
Should I keep hoping on?

Hey, I want you to the bone
I want you to the bone, bone

I want you to the bone, bone, bone, bone
I want you to the moon and back

<h2 style="font-family:verdana;color:lightgray;"id="C5">Mr. Loverman</h2>
<pre><p style="font-family:verdana;color:white;font-size;160%">I'm headed straight for the floor
The alcohol served its tour
And it's headed straight for my skin
Leaving me daft and dim

I've got this shake in my legs
Shaking the thoughts from my head
But who put these waves in the door?
I crack and out I pour

I'm Mr. Loverman
And I miss my lover, man
I'm Mr. Loverman
Oh, and I miss my lover

The ways in which you talk to me
Have me wishin' I were gone
The ways that you say my name
Have me runnin' on and on

Oh, I'm cramping up, I'm cramping up
But you're cracking up, you're cracking up

I'm Mr. Loverman
And I miss my loverman
I'm Mr. Loverman
Oh, and I miss my lover

I've shattered now, I'm spilling out
Upon this linoleum ground (Mr. Loverman)
I'm reeling in my brain again
Before it can get back to you (Mr. Loverman)
Oh, what am I supposed to do without you?

I'm Mr. Loverman
And I miss my lover, man (I miss my lover)
I'm Mr. Loverman (oh-oh)
Oh, and I miss my lover (Mr. Loverman)

I'm Mr. Loverman (oh-oh)
And I miss my loverman
I'm Mr. Loverman
And I miss my lover.
