<h2 style="font-family:verdana;color:lightgray;"id="C1">Grenade</h2>
<pre><p style="font-family:verdana;color:white;font-size;160%">Easy come, easy go, that's just how you live
Oh, take, take, take it all but you never give
Should've known you was trouble from the first kiss
Had your eyes wide open, why were they open?

Gave you all I had, and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, you did
To give me all your love is all I ever asked
'Cause what you don't understand is

I'd catch a grenade for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw my hand on a blade for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know I'd do anything for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah), oh, oh
I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for you, baby
But you won't do the same

No, no, no, no
Uh

Black, black, black and blue, beat me 'til I'm numb
Tell the devil I said "hey" when you get back to where you're from
Mad woman, bad woman, that's just what you are
Yeah, you'll smile in my face, then rip the brakes out my car

Gave you all I had, and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, yes, you did
To give me all your love is all I ever asked
'Cause what you don't understand is

I'd catch a grenade for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw my hand on a blade for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know I'd do anything for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah), oh, oh
I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for you, baby
But you won't do the same

If my body was on fire
Ooh, you'd watch me burn down in flames
You said you loved me, you're a liar
'Cause you never, ever, ever did, baby

(Uh) But darlin', I'd still catch a grenade for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw my hand on a blade for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know I'd do anything for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah), oh, oh
I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for you, baby
But you won't do the same

No, you won't do the same
You wouldn't do the same
Ooh, you'd never do the same
No, no, no, no.

<h2 style="font-family:verdana;color:lightgray;"id="C2">Line Without A Hook</h2>
<pre><p style="font-family:verdana;color:white;font-size;160%">I don't really give a damn about the way you touch me
When we're alone
You can hold my hand
If no one's home
Do you like it when I'm away?
If I went and hurt my body, baby
Would you love me the same?
I can feel all my bones coming back
And I'm craving motion
Mama never really learned how to live by herself

It's a curse
And it's growing
You're a pond and I'm an ocean
Oh, all my emotions
Feel like explosions when you are around
And I've found a way to kill the sounds, oh

Oh, baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you
I need you here to stay
I broke all my bones that day I found you
Crying at the lake
Was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden?
Oh, and if I could take it all back
I swear that I would pull you from the tide

Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
I said no, I said no
Listen close, it's a no
The wind is a-pounding on my back
And I found hope in a heart attack
Oh, at last, it is past
Now I've got it, and you can't have it

Oh, baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you
I need you here to stay
I broke all my bones that day I found you
Crying at the lake
Was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden? Oh
And if I could take it all back
I swear that I would pull you from the tide

Darling, when I'm fast asleep
I've seen this person watching me
Saying, "Is it worth it? Is it worth it? Tell me, is it worth it?"

'Cause there is something, and there is nothing
There is nothing in between
And in my eyes, there is a tiny dancer
Watching over me, he's singing
"She's a, she's a lady, and I am just a boy"
He's singing, "She's a, she's a lady, and I am just a line without a hook"

Oh, baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you
I need you here to stay
Broke all my bones that day I found you
Crying at the lake
Was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden? Oh
And if I could take it all back
I swear that I would pull you from the tide

<h2 style="font-family:verdana;color:lightgray;"id="C3">Television/ So Far So Good</h2>
<pre><p style="font-family:verdana;color:white;font-size;160%">Hey- I'm not afraid, I can be myself and I
Hope you can be yourself as well 'cause I can make you feel alright
And there was so much happiness that we were still yet to find
I said that you can call me Alex baby, welcome to my life

But don't you worry, don't you- don't worry girl
No, I'm not sure if I'm into you
The last time that you checked I was probably so sad and confused
I don't know, no, I don't know what you like
But if you're looking for something new
I know somebody that you could choose

What about me
What about me
What about me and you together
Something that could really last forever
What about me
What about me
What about me and you together
Something that could really last forever

If all my friends wanna be in her bed
Then I begin to wonder why
I guess that I'd be lying to myself
'Cause who the fuck
Would be dumb enough
To reject an offer?
Oh what an offer?
Now two two ten one five
Couple hours can change your life
Frankie saying oh what a night
What a night
What the fuck is a girlfriend
I'ma need advice
Maybe I should go outside
So I could get a fucking life
I made a friend and she spent the night now

I'm in love and she remains in my life
I'm back and we spoke in Europe
I need insurance
On my emotions
I can't get hurt again
Fuck the past, fuck them, they all made me sad
And I had no time to prepare to face my fears
I guess that it's time that I dried these tears

But if I could just be happy by the end of this song
But if by the time you hear it you are already gone
And it didn't go to plan
Then why should I continue in this life
When there's no one around to be the one who makes me smile
So far everything's good
(Ooooh)
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
So far everything's good
Oh oh oh
(Ooooh)
No no no
No no no no no oh oh ow
Want the crowd in tears when they hear this
Is that so wrong?

<h2 style="font-family:verdana;color:lightgray;"id="C4">Best Friend</h2>
<pre><p style="font-family:verdana;color:white;font-size;160%"> I should've stayed at home
'Cause right now I see all these people that love me
But I still feel alone
Can't help but check my phone
I could've made you mine
But no, it wasn't meant to be and see, I wasn't made for you
And you weren't made for me
Though it seemed so easy

And that's because I wanna be your favorite boy
I wanna be the one that makes your day
The one you think about as you lie awake
I can't wait to be your number one
I'll be your biggest fan and you'll be mine
But I still wanna break your heart and make you cry

But won't you wait?
You know it's too late
I'm on my own shit now
Let me tell you how it feels to be fucking great
I feel great
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
You need to be yourself
Love someone for loving you instead of someone really cool
That makes your heart melt
Who knows what you truly felt?
You're still my favorite girl
You better trust me when I tell you
There ain't no one else more beautiful in this damn world
In this damn world

You're gonna wanna be my best friend, baby
You're gonna wanna be my best friend
I said that
You're gonna wanna be my best friend, baby
You're gonna wanna be my best friend, best friend
You're gonna wanna be my best friend, baby
You're gonna wanna be my best friend
Best friend
You're gonna wanna be my best friend, baby
You're gonna wanna be my best friend

I say that I'm happy
I say that I'm happy
But no, no, no, no
No, no, no

Oh, I still wanna be your favorite boy
I wanna be the one that makes your day
The one you think about as you lie awake
And I can't wait to be your number, your number one
I'll be your biggest fan and you'll be mine
But I still wanna break your heart and make you cry

I still wanna be your favorite boy
I wanna be the one
I might just be the one

<h2 style="font-family:verdana;color:lightgray;"id="C5">Mr. Loverman</h2>
<pre><p style="font-family:verdana;color:white;font-size;160%">I'm headed straight for the floor
The alcohol served its tour
And it's headed straight for my skin
Leaving me daft and dim

I've got this shake in my legs
Shaking the thoughts from my head
But who put these waves in the door?
I crack and out I pour

I'm Mr. Loverman
And I miss my lover, man
I'm Mr. Loverman
Oh, and I miss my lover

The ways in which you talk to me
Have me wishin' I were gone
The ways that you say my name
Have me runnin' on and on

Oh, I'm cramping up, I'm cramping up
But you're cracking up, you're cracking up

I'm Mr. Loverman
And I miss my loverman
I'm Mr. Loverman
Oh, and I miss my lover

I've shattered now, I'm spilling out
Upon this linoleum ground (Mr. Loverman)
I'm reeling in my brain again
Before it can get back to you (Mr. Loverman)
Oh, what am I supposed to do without you?

I'm Mr. Loverman
And I miss my lover, man (I miss my lover)
I'm Mr. Loverman (oh-oh)
Oh, and I miss my lover (Mr. Loverman)

I'm Mr. Loverman (oh-oh)
And I miss my loverman
I'm Mr. Loverman
And I miss my lover
